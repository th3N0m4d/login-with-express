# Login with Express

Ever wondered how to authenticate users with Express and MongoDB? Or, have you ever wondered how to authorize routes so that only authenticated and authorzied users can have access to them? That's all this project is about. 

Here you will find all the major concepts and techniques to successfully implement a Login page with modern tools, such as Express, Typescript and MongoDB. I also added some strategies to help you make sure your code runs, by implementing TDD with Jest.
